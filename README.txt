NOTE ABOUT PASSWORD.TXT: We believe password.txt is a poor choice for storing all users passwords. Instead we chose to have each object store its on password because it 	would mean that all changes in passwords would require less resources to complete. We believe our design choice is superior to the passwords.txt way and therefore
	have not implemented it. To Login as an admin use credentials Username/Email: a, Password = password. To Login as client use credentials Username/Email: c, Password = password.
